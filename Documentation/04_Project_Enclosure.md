# Project Enclosure

## 3D Printed Enclosure

The [enclosure provided](../3D_Printable_Models) includes STL files ready for slicing and the source models editable in the free edition of [SketchUp Make](https://www.sketchup.com/download).

### 3D Printing Notes

The careful observer might note that the dimensions of the model vary just slightly from the [published dimensions](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/images/a/ad/2.4%27%27_Nextion_Dimension.pdf) of the panel used in this project.  This has been done to accommodate the nature of FDM 3D printing, which means that other production technologies may require slight modifications to make everything fit snug.  The STLs are published in the correct orientation for printing.

I printed these two parts with [Atomic Filament Bright White PLA](https://atomicfilament.com/products/bright-white-pla-filament) on a [Prusa i3 MK2S](http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/59-original-prusa-i3-mk2-kit.html) with 75% infill, .1mm layers, no supports, and 10 bottom layers.  The finished results look almost injection molded.

## Assembling the completed project

### Heat-set inserts

To hold the two halves on the enclosure together I've used [three 20mm M2 flat-head screws](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-M2x20mm-Phillips-Countersunk-Machine/dp/B01DKI5QIO) through the rear of the enclosure into a set of three [3mm M2 heat-set threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Female-Knurled-Threaded-Embedment/dp/B01IYWTCWW).  For installation I'm using a conical tip on my soldering iron set at 350Â°F to heat up the insert and press into the front plate.

I've threaded in a brass standoff I had laying around to prevent melted plastic from entering the nut during assembly and to give myself a handle to position and retain the insert when removing the soldering iron.  The model includes a small cutout for the inserts to sit centered on their hole in preparation for installation, so I just set the insert in place, heat it for a moment with the iron, gently press until it's inserted, then hold the standoff with some pliers (it's hot!) while I remove the iron and adjust to make sure it's reasonably vertical while the plastic is still pliable.  Be careful not to press in too far or you'll leave a dimple in the front of the plate!

Installing the protoboard requires a pair of small m2-ish screws, I had some machine thread flatheads on hand but some self-tapping (or wood thread or sheet metal etc) might be more suitable as this is cutting into plastic.  There shouldn't be much strain on these two so I haven't bothered with inserts here.

Once everything is fit together then it's a simple matter of running the three 20mm m2 screws through the back to hold the two halves of the enclosure together.  Again, be careful not to tighten these too hard as the screws can dimple the front of the switch plate.  Now you should be ready to mount into the wall!

# Switch Plate model for single-gang workbox

This model is still WIP.  Some of the dimensions have been altered from the physical device to accommodate characteristics of FDM printing (so, some interior dimensions are oversized).  This print fits like a glove when printed on a Prusa i3 Mk2 with Atomic Filament PLA.

The mounting holes for the Nextion panel are sized to fit [M2 x 3mm heat-set threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.com/a16041800ux0765-Cylinder-Knurled-Threaded-Embedded/dp/B01IZ15A5U) but should accept an M3 screw (tightly).

The Sketchup file included here is dimensioned in meters but 1m == 1mm due to issues with how Sketchup (doesn't) handle small dimensions.  If you intend to modify the provided Sketchup model, export to STL in meters then import for print in mm (the standard setting for most slicers) and you'll be fine.  The included STL is ready to slice as-is.

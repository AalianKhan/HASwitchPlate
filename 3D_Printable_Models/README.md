# Switch Plate model for single-gang workbox

## 3D Printed Enclosure
Above you'll find STL files ready for slicing and the source models editable in the free edition of [SketchUp Make](https://www.sketchup.com/download).  

### 3D Printing Notes
The careful observer might note that the dimensions of the model vary just slightly from the [published dimensions](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/images/a/ad/2.4%27%27_Nextion_Dimension.pdf) of the panel used in this project.  This has been done to accommodate the nature of FDM 3D printing, which means that other production technologies may require slight modifications to make everything fit snug.  The STLs are published in the correct orientation for printing.

I printed these two parts with [Atomic Filament Bright White PLA](https://atomicfilament.com/products/bright-white-pla-filament) on a [Prusa i3 MK2S](http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/59-original-prusa-i3-mk2-kit.html) with 75% infill, .1mm layers, no supports, and 10 bottom layers.  The finished results look almost injection molded.

The mounting holes for the Nextion panel are sized to fit [M2 x 3mm heat-set threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.com/a16041800ux0765-Cylinder-Knurled-Threaded-Embedded/dp/B01IZ15A5U) but should accept an M3 screw (tightly).

The SketchUp file included here is dimensioned in meters but 1m == 1mm due to issues with how SketchUp (doesn't) handle small dimensions.  If you intend to modify the provided SketchUp model, export to STL in meters then import for print in mm (the standard setting for most slicers) and you'll be fine.  The included STL is ready to slice as-is.
